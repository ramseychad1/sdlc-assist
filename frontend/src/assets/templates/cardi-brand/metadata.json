  "promptHint": "Generate a design system aligned with Cardinal Health's professional healthcare brand identity. Use Cardinal red (#e41f35) as the primary action color for buttons, active states, and key interactive elements. Apply soft neutral backgrounds: #f3f3f3 for the page background, #efefef for muted surfaces, #dedede for secondary elements, and white (#ffffff) for cards and sidebar. Use light blue (#bbdde6) as an accent for info alerts and highlighted sections. Success and warning states both use light yellow (#fde69f) with dark text. The sidebar is 256px with white background and subtle borders. Apply 6px border-radius consistently. Use Geist or Inter as the typeface with 13px body text for information density. PRD section headers (h2) should be colored in Cardinal red. The overall aesthetic prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and trust — appropriate for healthcare enterprise software. Avoid decorative elements, heavy shadows, or anything that detracts from professional credibility."
